![Times Square Feature](https://github.com/SQLicious/HiCounselor-Real-World-Projects/blob/main/Loan%20Analysis/Inputs/images/Loan%20Analysis.png)

#### Overview
Dive into the world of Fintech with this project! Explore the intricacies of predicting creditworthiness, tailoring loan terms, and minimizing default rates using SQL queries. Get insights into the factors determining loan approval and rejection.

#### Approach
- Cleaned up 82,708 records with Python and Pandas.
- Loaded cleaned data into an SQL database.
- Explored loan statistics, job impact on borrowing, repayment duration, borrower ratings, and homeownership influence on loan approval.

#### Coolest Findings
- Basic loan stats: counts, average interest rates, highs, and lows of loan amounts.
- Impact of job on borrowing capacity.
- Loan repayment duration and status analysis.
- Ratings and the role of homeownership in loan approval.

### Jan 2024 Project:  Medical Dataset Analysis: Using Python and SQL

![Times Square Feature](https://github.com/SQLicious/HiCounselor-Real-World-Projects/blob/main/Medical%20Dataset%20Analysis/Images/Medical%20Analysis%20project.png)

#### Overview
Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project, focusing on three essential datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." The project consists of two main modules:

### 1. Data Cleaning:
I used Python to enhance data accuracy and structure, ensuring the datasets are well-prepared for meaningful analysis and extracting valuable insights. These steps were performed on hospitalization_details,csv and medical_examinations,csv files

### 2. SQL-Powered Insights:
In the second module, utilize SQL queries to extract insightful information from the refined datasets. Delve into healthcare data to facilitate informed decision-making and optimize resource allocation in the healthcare sector.


#### Approach
- Cleaned up 82,708 records with Python and Pandas.
- Loaded cleaned data into an SQL database.
- Explored loan statistics, job impact on borrowing, repayment duration, borrower ratings, and homeownership influence on loan approval.

#### Key Findings
- Basic loan stats: counts, average interest rates, highs, and lows of loan amounts.
- Impact of job on borrowing capacity.
- Loan repayment duration and status analysis.
- Ratings and the role of homeownership in loan approval.
