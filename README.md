### Jan 2024 Project:  Medical Dataset Analysis: Using Python and SQL

![Times Square Feature](https://github.com/SQLicious/HiCounselor-Real-World-Projects/blob/main/Medical%20Dataset%20Analysis/Images/Medical%20Analysis%20project.png)

#### Overview
Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project, focusing on three essential datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." The project consists of two main modules:

### 1. Data Cleaning:
I used Python to enhance data accuracy and structure, ensuring the datasets are well-prepared for meaningful analysis and extracting valuable insights. These steps were performed on hospitalization_details,csv and medical_examinations,csv files

### 2. SQL-Powered Insights:
In the second module, utilize SQL queries to extract insightful information from the refined datasets. Delve into healthcare data to facilitate informed decision-making and optimize resource allocation in the healthcare sector.


#### Approach
- Cleaned up 82,708 records with Python and Pandas.
- Loaded cleaned data into an SQL database.
- Explored loan statistics, job impact on borrowing, repayment duration, borrower ratings, and homeownership influence on loan approval.

#### Benefits:

- Gain practical experience in data cleaning techniques for healthcare datasets.
- Enhance proficiency in SQL queries for extracting meaningful insights from three different medical datasets.
- Develop understanding healthcare domain by driving data-driven solutions.
-  Illuminate the path to actionable insights, shaping the future of healthcare analytics.

#### Key Findings
- Basic loan stats: counts, average interest rates, highs, and lows of loan amounts.
- Impact of job on borrowing capacity.
- Loan repayment duration and status analysis.
- Ratings and the role of homeownership in loan approval.
